The workflow is divided into two main modules:

1. **Green Area**: This module is responsible for generating text-guided, full-body, face-preserving images using TIFF.
2. **Red Area**: This module animates the generated full-body images.

## How to Use workflow.json in ComfyUI

To use the `TIFF_ComfyUI_workflow.json` file in ComfyUI, follow these steps:

1. **Open ComfyUI**:
    - Start ComfyUI on your machine. Ensure that you have it installed and properly configured.

2. **Locate the workflow.json File**:
    - Ensure you have the `TIFF_ComfyUI_workflow.json` file available on your system. This file contains the configuration for the workflow.

3. **Load the workflow.json File**:
    - In ComfyUI, navigate to the `File` menu.
    - Select `Import Workflow`.
    - Browse to the location of the `TIFF_ComfyUI_workflow.json` file and select it.

4. **Verify the Workflow**:
    - Once loaded, verify that the workflow appears correctly in ComfyUI.
    - Ensure all connections and nodes are properly configured as expected.

5. **Run the Workflow**:
    - After verifying the setup, you can start the workflow.
    - Monitor the process to ensure it runs smoothly and produces the expected outputs.

By following these steps, you can effectively utilize the `workflow.json` file within ComfyUI to execute the pre-defined workflow.
